# Comparison Operators

## loops:  
## **COMPARISON OPERATORS: EVALUATING CONDITIONS.**
###  You can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be. The result will be a Boolean: true or false.
1. **==** **IS EQUAL TO**

2. **!=** **IS NOT EQUAL TO**

3. **===** **STRICT EQUAL TO**

4. **!==** **STRICT NOT EQUAL TO**

5. **<** **LESS THAN**

6. **>** **GREATER THAN**

7. **<=** **LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO**

8. **>=** **GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO**  

## **LOOPS**
### Loops check a condition. If it returns true, a code block will run. Then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns true, the code block will run again. It repeats until the condition returns false. There are three common types of loops:
1. ***FOR***
2. ***WHILE***
# For and  While loops
***For*** is used if you nedd to run for a known number of times ***For loop*** consist of ***keyword*** which is For and a ***condition*** gives boolean value and a ***counter*** 

***While*** is used if you dont know how many times the code should run ***while loops*** consist of **keyword** which is While and a ***condition*** gives boolean value
