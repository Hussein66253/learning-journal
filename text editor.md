### A text editor is a computer program that lets a user enter, change, store, and usually print text (characters and numbers, each encoded by the computer and its input and output devices, arranged to have meaning to users or to other programs) typically a text editor provides an "empty" display screen  with a fixed-line length and visible line numbers we can then fill the lines in with text, line by line a special command line lets us move to a new page, scroll forward or backward, make global changes in the document, save the document, and perform other actions. After saving a document, you can then print it or display it. Before printing or displaying it, you may be able to format it for some specific output device or class of output device. text editors can be used to enter program language source statements or to create documents such as technical manuals.
